**How it Works?**
- User Input: Users provide their preferences using sliders, multiselect boxes, and text inputs, which are formatted as JSON objects and stored in variables.
- OpenAI API Interaction: The application calls the OpenAI API using chat.completions.create() endpoint and passes a prompt with placeholder tokens and the JSON objects 
  entered by users.
- Model Processing: The API sends the request to the Language Model (LLM), which parses through the prompt and JSON objects to generate a response tailored to the user's input.
- Response Generation: The generated responses, which include personalized travel itineraries, are returned by the API and made available for download as a PDF format for the user's convenience.
